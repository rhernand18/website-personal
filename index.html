        <h2>About Me</h2>
        I am a proud, 1st generation daughter of two Mexican parents,
        Brigida Luis Vasquez and Fransisco Almaraz Hernandez. My parents
        migrated to California in the late 1980's to pursue the American
        Dream. My mother gave up her promising career as a well-respected
        teacher so that her two children, at the time, could have a better
        life. My parents raised, supported, and saw that all their 5 children
        graduated high school and went on to venture their own career paths.
        I am the 4th child, the second US born citizen, to Brigida and
        Francisco Hernandez, and I am happy to share my history with you all.
